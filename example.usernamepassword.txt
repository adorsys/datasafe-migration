# It is assumed, that no username contains a password
# and no username starts with a #
#
# Each non empty line not starting with a # is assumed
# to contain a user and the password. The delimiter between
# user and password is a white space.
# So each line contains at least one white space. The
# first whitespace is the end of the user. Each char
# after the first whitespace until the new line is assumed
# to belong to the password
